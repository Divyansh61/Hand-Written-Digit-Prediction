# Hand-Written-Digit-Prediction

Handwritten Digit Classification, also known as Handwritten Digit Prediction, is analogous to teaching a computer to read and comprehend handwritten numbers in the same way as humans do. Consider a collection of images, each of which displays a handwritten number between 0 and 9. Teaching the computer to recognize which digit is in each of these images is the aim. We divided our images into two sets: a training set for teaching the computer and a testing set for evaluating its abilities. For the computer to recognize patterns and distinctions in the images, we select a clever technique, such as a unique formula for solving problems. We help it learn by indicating whether or not its estimates are correct. After it has mastered this ability, we present it with fresh images that it hasn't seen during training, and it makes every effort to guess the right number. We use basic checks to verify if it is correctly estimating the numbers in order to assess how well it is performing. In order to assist computers comprehend our handwriting or read postal codes, this project teaches us how to create a computer that can detect handwritten digits. It's similar to teaching your handwriting to a machine.
